### Common Questions to Answer

**Q: How does it work?**

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Storytellers have 15 hours of conversation time and can go at their own pace - some prefer daily sessions, others spread it over months. After conversations are complete, our team takes 4-6 weeks to professionally curate and create the legacy package.

**Q: Can I gift this to someone?**
A: Absolutely! Many people purchase this as a meaningful gift for parents, grandparents, or loved ones. We provide a beautiful digital gift certificate you can present to them.

**Q: What if they're not tech-savvy?**
A: The experience is designed to be simple - just talk naturally, like we're doing now. If they can have a phone conversation, they can create their legacy. Our support team is also available to help.
